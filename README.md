# 🎓 Udemy Home Page Clone  

## 📝 Introduction  
This project is a clone of the Udemy website, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It was one of the first projects I worked on, and it gave me a lot of confidence to continue learning and improving my web development skills.  

Currently, the website is not responsive, but I plan to make it fully responsive whenever I get the time to work on it further.
